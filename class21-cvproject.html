							An individual's identity will be apparent where it can be determined from the information itself, without referring to any other information. For example:where the information includes the person's name
							where the information includes the person's photograph, where they can be clearly seen in the photograph; or
							where the information is so unique that it cannot be anyone else, for example, if the information says it is about 'the woman who wears a crown and was Queen of England in 2008'.
